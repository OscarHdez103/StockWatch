# StockWatch
BrisHack 2023

Theme: My Utopia

Idea:
Website to monitor the stock of all UK supermarkets to provide full transparency to the public. The government would have to legislate that all supermarkets provide access to their stock data which would be collated in this large database for anyone to query.

Framework: Streamlit

Database: SQLite
